Description: Genomic analysis of model organisms often requires the use of databases based on human data or making comparisons to patient-derived resources. This requires converting genes between human and non-human analogues. The babelgene R package provides predicted gene orthologs/homologs for frequently studied model organisms in an R-friendly tidy/long format. The package integrates orthology assertion predictions sourced from multiple databases as compiled by the HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP) (Wright et al. 2005 <doi:10.1007/s00335-005-0103-2>, Eyre et al. 2007 <doi:10.1093/bib/bbl030>, Seal et al. 2011 <doi:10.1093/nar/gkq892>).
